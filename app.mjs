/*

The assignment is free-form: create a client side web application that makes use of two or more 3rd party APIs.

Turn in your code as a repository to GradeScope. Include a README explaining what the application is and which 3rd party APIs were used.

Completing this assignment will be worth an additional 2% added to your course grade. In other words, if you would have gotten a B- with 82% of the points for the course and completed this assignment, you will then be given a course grade that corresponds to 84%, a B, instead.
